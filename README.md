Donors can access a real-time map displaying ongoing natural disasters, allowing them to make informed decisions on where their contributions are most needed.

Project Value 💰
The project is aimed at helping those in the path of natural disasters. Donors can immediately donate points to support in the evacuation, while also receiving benfits down the road as a result. Donors help someone less fortunate now, while reaping the benefits of their kindness down the road.
